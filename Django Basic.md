- **manage.py** does the same thing as **django-admin** but also sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable so that it points to the project’s settings.py file.
- django-admin is Django’s command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes.
- request.POST is a dictionary-like object that lets you access submitted data by key name.
- Always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing with POST data. This prevents data from being posted twice if a user hits the Back button.
