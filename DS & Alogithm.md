### Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

### Types of Data Structure

Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

-   Linear data structure
	- Array
	- Stack
	- Queue
	- Linked List
-   Non-linear data structure
	- Graph
		-   [Spanning Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/spanning-tree-and-minimum-spanning-tree)
		-   [Strongly Connected Components](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/strongly-connected-components)
		-   [Adjacency Matrix](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-adjacency-matrix)
		-   [Adjacency List](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-adjacency-list)
	- Trees
		- [Binary Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/binary-tree)
		-   [Binary Search Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/binary-search-tree)
		-   [AVL Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/avl-tree)
		-   [B-Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-tree)
		-   [B+ Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-plus-tree)
		-   [Red-Black Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/red-black-tree)
