### Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

### Types of Data Structure

Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

-   Linear data structure
	- Array
	- Stack
	- Queue
	- Linked List
-   Non-linear data structure
	- Graph
		-   [Spanning Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/spanning-tree-and-minimum-spanning-tree)
		-   [Strongly Connected Components](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/strongly-connected-components)
		-   [Adjacency Matrix](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-adjacency-matrix)
		-   [Adjacency List](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph-adjacency-list)
	- Trees
		- [Binary Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/binary-tree)
		-   [Binary Search Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/binary-search-tree)
		-   [AVL Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/avl-tree)
		-   [B-Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-tree)
		-   [B+ Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/b-plus-tree)
		-   [Red-Black Tree](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/red-black-tree)

The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other.

The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner).

All the items are present on the single layer.

The data items are present at different layers.

It can be traversed on a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all the elements sequentially in a single pass.

It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass.

The memory utilization is not efficient.

Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need.

The time complexity increase with the data size.

Time complexity remains the same.

Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue

Example: Tree, Graph, Map
