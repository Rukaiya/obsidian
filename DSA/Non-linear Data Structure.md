### Tree
A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).
- Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.
#### Height of a Tree

The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
